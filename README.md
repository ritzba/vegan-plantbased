#  Vegan vs. Plant-Based Diet 

## Marketing Strategies for Organic Grocers

Whole Foods is a national chain serving customers with high-quality organic produce and all-natural grocery products from around the world.  Many of its customers are deeply motivated by concerns for the environment and for animal welfare.  Many have committed to reducing or eliminating their consumption of animal meat, animal milk, or even all products of animal origin (often including non-food items as well).

The term "vegan" (or "veganism") refers to abstention from consumption of any products of animal origin.  More recently, the term "plant-based food" (or "plant-based diet") has become interchangeable with the vegan diet.  The definition of plant-based diet is somewhat amorphous.  A report on plant-based diets by the World Health Organization defines a plant-based diet as merely having an emphasis on consuming foods of plant origin.  The WHO's definition allows for some consumption of animal products, and possibly even meat in limited amounts. 

Despite its elusiveness, the term "plant-based diet" is popular, with almost 30,000 posts on the PlantBasedDiet subreddit.  A more nuanced understanding of how this term is applied can assist in developing strategies to market grocery products to people who eat (or aspire to eat) a healthier diet.  

There are significantly more posts in r/vegan than r/PlantBasedDiet.  After retrieving and cleaning all the posts from both subreddits, 72% of our data was from r/Vegan.  Our predictive models were able to categorize posts with 85-89% accuracy.

More importantly, as a result of this process, we were able to generate lists of terms which are highly correlated with either the vegan or the plant-based subreddit.  Vegan posts contained high frequencies of personal and sentimental terms, such as "know", "want" and "think."  PlantBasedDiet posts contained high frequencies of practical terms, such as "weight (loss)", "recipes", and "oil."

One of the most interesting distinctions was in each group's preferred unit of time.  The most frequent unit of time mentioned in vegan posts is a year, while the most frequent unit of time mentioned in plant-based posts is a week.  This observation is consistent with plant-based diet as being focused on practical, weekly meal prep.  Veganism, on the other hand, is more connected to a person's overall ideology and identity, and less with everyday needs.

Whole Foods carries hundreds of products which are labelled and often certified as being vegan, plant-based, or both.  Organic grocers like Whole Foods can employ this new understanding of discourse in the vegan and plant-based communities to design advertising and promotions which cater to the unique focus and perspective of each community.
